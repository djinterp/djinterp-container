/*
d_min_stack_new
  Allocates and initializes a new (empty) `d_min_stack`.
  A min-stack (minimal stack) is a LIFO (last in, first out) stack data
structure optimized to occupy minimal space.

Parameter(s):
  none
Return:
  A `struct d_min_stack` pointer corresponding to either:
  1. an address in memory corresponding to the newly-initialized `struct 
     d_min_stack`, if memory allocation was successful, or
  2. NULL, if memory allocation was unsuccessful.

d_min_stack_peek
  Views the top element on a stack without removing it.

first-out) principle.

Parameter(s):

Return:
  a pointer to the value on the top of the stack, or NULL if stack is empty or NULL
